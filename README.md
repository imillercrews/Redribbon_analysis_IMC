# Redribbon_analysis_IMC

I put together a R function for the RedRibbon package that makes it really easy to use if you just want to input your 2 gene lists from the 2 DEG analyses you want to compare. Additionally, it lets you name the variables on the graph output and set the max value for the scale for easy comparison across multiple RRHO runs. 

You just need to run everything and then at the end of this script is where you input your data.
